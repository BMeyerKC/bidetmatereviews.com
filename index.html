                    <p>Their customer support is only available from 10am to 2pm EST, Monday through Friday. That's only 4 hours a day! I work during those hours and needed help over the weekend when I discovered a leak. By the time I could reach them on Monday, my bathroom floor was damaged. When I finally got through, I was on hold for 45 minutes. Completely unacceptable for a $300+ product.</p>

                    <strong>Return Policy is a Complete Rip-Off</strong>
                    <p>The unit I received was defective right out of the box - water pressure was inconsistent and the control panel didn't work properly. When I tried to return it, I found out their "30-day money back guarantee" is misleading. I had to pay $42 for return shipping AND they charged me a 25% restocking fee ($87!). So returning a defective product cost me $129 total. I tried to argue it was defective but they insisted their "policy is policy." Never again.</p>

                    <strong>No Online Community or Real Support</strong>
                    <p>Before buying, I tried to find a BidetMate community on Reddit or Facebook to ask questions - nothing exists. Their social media pages are ghost towns with no real customer interaction. I found maybe 3-4 reviews online, all on suspicious-looking websites. Should have been a red flag. After purchasing, I had installation questions and there's nowhere to turn except their limited phone hours. Other bidet companies have active communities where customers help each other - not BidetMate.</p>

                    <strong>Installation Nightmare - Missing Parts</strong>
                    <p>The installation instructions were poorly translated and confusing. Worse yet, my unit was missing the T-valve adapter. I called customer support (during their tiny 4-hour window) and they said they'd ship one. It took 3 weeks to arrive! Meanwhile, I had this expensive bidet sitting in my bathroom, unusable. The mounting hardware was also different from what the instructions showed, making me wonder if this is even a quality product or some cheap knockoff.</p>

                    <strong>Product Quality is Questionable</strong>
                    <p>After 2 months of light use, the plastic housing cracked and started leaking. The "premium" materials advertised are clearly cheap plastic. I tried contacting support but of course, they're only available during business hours when I'm at work. I finally reached them and they wanted me to pay to ship it back for a "warranty inspection" before they'd even consider replacing it. This is a $350 product that failed after 60 days!</p>

                    <strong>Can't Trust the Reviews - They All Seem Fake</strong>
                    <p>I should have been more careful. All the "reviews" I found online were on their website or sketchy affiliate sites. Nothing on Amazon, no detailed YouTube reviews from trusted channels, zero presence on consumer review sites. I tried searching Reddit for "BidetMate" and found almost nothing - just a couple of suspicious accounts posting generic praise. Real products have real communities discussing them. BidetMate doesn't, which should tell you everything.</p>

                    <strong>Water Pressure Problems and No Help</strong>
                    <p>The water pressure is either too weak to be effective or so strong it's uncomfortable - there's no middle ground despite having a "pressure control dial." I've tried adjusting it dozens of times. Called support (scheduled PTO just to call during their absurdly limited hours) and the rep basically read from a script that didn't help at all. They offered no real troubleshooting and seemed eager to get me off the phone. Save your money and buy from a reputable company.</p>

                    <strong>Warranty is Worthless</strong>
                    <p>They advertise a "2-year warranty" but read the fine print - it doesn't cover installation issues, water damage, or "improper use" (which they get to define). When my unit failed after 4 months, they claimed it was due to "improper installation" even though I followed their instructions exactly. They wanted photos, receipts, and a detailed timeline before they'd even consider honoring the warranty. Then they ghosted me for 3 weeks. Their limited support hours make following up nearly impossible.</p>

                    <strong>Avoid This Company - Learn From My Mistake</strong>
                    <p>This was my first bidet purchase and BidetMate has soured the entire experience. Between the limited support hours, expensive return policy, lack of any legitimate third-party reviews, and poor product quality, I feel scammed. I've since purchased a unit from a competitor (with thousands of real Amazon reviews and active Reddit communities) and the difference is night and day. BidetMate cuts every corner possible and it shows. Don't make my $350 mistake.</p>
